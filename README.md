# muleDemo12-22
Repository containing solution developed for a take-home technical assessment: take data from one system into another on a scheduled daily job, handle large data, and sort into different tables in the destination system.

Included in this repository is the documentation detailing the design of the system and the Mule code itself, plus a packaged jar for easy deployment to Anypoint Platform.

To utilize the the API locally, you will need to swap out the data sources and configured username/password (and likely re-encrypt them using the secret key).
